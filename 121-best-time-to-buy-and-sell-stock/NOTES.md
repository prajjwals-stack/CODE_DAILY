idea is  to buy stock at least price posible and sell with max profit
​
if we buy stock on day 1 sells it the same day our profit will be zero.
but if we buy  the stocks at high price and sell it at low price we will at loss
so keeping all this is mind we need to buy stock at the lowest price possible and sell it at the max price ..
